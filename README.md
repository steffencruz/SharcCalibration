SharcCalibration
================
-> Finish TSharcFormat and replace TSharcName with it                         
-> Get TCalibrate up and running so that compiles                         
-> Get TCalibrate to make charge matrices                         
-> Make and fit charge spectra   
-> Make centroid matrices
-> Make energy calculated matrices
-> Make calibration graphs (run only)     


WHERE ARE MY CALIBRATIONS???? 
also excitation energies... now.
